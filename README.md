haXe gamejam kit
================

A quick and dirty gamejam kit that handles the boring crap I don't want to do at every jam.

Built in haXe via OpenFL 1.1

This framework will eventually include:
- Simple scene management
- Audio handling
- Input handling (keys/gamepad support)
- Math/string utils etc
- Entity/pooling stuff
- Some visual stuff from old games (particles etc)
- Animation helpers
