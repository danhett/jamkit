haXe gamejam kit
================

A quick and dirty gamejam kit that handles the framework stuff I don't want to do at every jam.

Built in haXe via OpenFL 1.1

TODO:
- enhance scene management so scenes can be saved, currently destroys every time
- decent entity system (with pooling)
- drop in common math/physics stuff
- audio handling
- controller code
